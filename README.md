## üí° Simulation Highlights

### 1. Improving Loan Management System

* Leveraged **UML (Unified Modeling Language)** to create a detailed **state diagram**.
* This visual aid effectively clarified the intricate steps involved in the loan processing system and improved system design flow.

### 2. Machine Learning for Credit Risk Assessment

* Researched and recommended potential **machine learning algorithms** for assessing credit risk.
* The findings provided actionable recommendations for future steps to enhance Citi's risk assessment capabilities.

### 3. Real-Time Stock Market Risk Visualization

* Built a functional tool using **Java** to visualize **stock market risk** in real time.
* This tool delivered crucial insights into the risk factors affecting the stock market, facilitating quicker decision-making and better risk management.

### 4. System Design & Back-End Development

* Focused on **back-end development and system design**, with a particular emphasis on creating efficient processes for risk assessment and improving loan management.
* The designed system was architected to be scalable and seamlessly integrated with other internal tools.

### 5. Written Communication & Documentation

* Meticulously documented technical solutions in clear and concise language, ensuring complex processes and findings were accessible to stakeholders without technical expertise.
